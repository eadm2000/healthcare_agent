I have more control than others.\", \"But like, you know, like I don't control whether or not I have rehearsal that's like based on the semester and stuff and whether or not we have a concert coming up.\", \"So, you know, I had it Tech last week this week.\", \"I only have rehearsal on Tuesday night because\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"Are there other things you can do?\", \"Can you volunteer more?\", \"Can you schedule outings with friends so that you're not staying home?\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"Maybe I don't know whether or not there would be enough to because

[\"I noticed you were wearing dressy or clothes than usual.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"Yes, that was on purpose.\", \"So like maybe they'll be able to start me with something as soon as Monday if they could that would probably solve the problem at least while I'm at work and then I guess I'll have to deal with the panic in the evenings, but\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"If you even panicked.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"But of course that also assumes that work is something that doesn't take, you know to take a nap in my brain because I was just thinking like if I'm at work like especially now that I like finished actual project I needed to finish like if I'm just coming and he'll like do whatever like I don't know like hair is very talkative.\", \"So if I end up wasting time and talking to like Terrence F then like be occupied enough, so yeah, it depends on it really depends on what I do because lots of things still take up all my brain like last night when I was panicking said he was like, why don't you try knitting I was like, okay, I guess and I like try knitting and it did absolutely nothing which is what I figured it would because it wasn't really taking up enough my brain.\", \"So like I don't know if getting together cuz like hanging out with Sydney is not enough to make it go away most of the time even if we're like watching a TV show

there.\", \"So\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"Are there spots that trigger the panic?\", \"I know what that starts you say.\", \"You just kind of think I'm panicking and panicking, but I

just happens and then I just filled the physical thing feeling and then I'm just like, oh no not again, like the feeling doesn't come there's nothing that comes before the physical feeling as far as I can tell like I've never been so I'm pretty sure it's just happening and not being triggered by anything.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"And it feels really out of your control.\", \"I can

started like whenever we got home at like, you know, maybe like before midnight like I took my nighttime meds which included the Klonopin like when I got home and then I was still up for like another hour or so panicking and the Klonopins and nothing immediately.\", \"So, you know, which leads me to believe that if I had, you know earlier I taken a quarter Klonopin the same thing would have happened where it wouldn't have done anything mediately.\", \"So\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"So you don't feel like the Klonopin helped at all.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"I don't know like I guess it doesn't and used to help but not like if it does it doesn't such a subtle way that like it doesn't help immediately help as I could see working right away.\"]},

taking it out on him and I feel bad about doing that and\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"So you kind of flip-flopped a bit and he's been doing a little bit better and he's been doing a little bit worse.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"Yeah, I mean, sometimes he still has problems like doing things like getting out of the house, but in general like he's been doing a lot better than he had been.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"Do you think there's any connection?\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"Because he's doing better and I'm doing worse.\", \"I don't think

your body mentally and just taking notice of what your body feels like noticing any places that feel tight and tense anything that feels uncomfortable but yourself shift, however, you need to to relax those spaces.\", \"And then as you let yourself get more comfortable, but yourself extend your breath so that you're taking slightly longer Fuller inhales and exhales.\", \"I want you to try something

singing you do breathwork whether you're focusing on breathwork or not, right?\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"Yeah.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"It just happens to be saying so it's probably the Odyssey feeling is probably not about the air, but you felt it.\", \"So it means something.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"I guess.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"So maybe it's just uncomfortable for you.\", \"So it's not dangerous, you know, you can breathe for a count of four.\", \"You've held a note longer than that.\", \"So it's not about whether you really have enough air, but something about focusing on it felt different to help dizzy.\", \"That doesn't have to be a bad feeling.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"dialogue\": [\"Okay.\", \"Yeah, I like to breathe in and out before I get that extra for for holding it because yeah, I guess I'm used to\", \"heading out over a long.\", \"Of time.\"]}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"dialogue\": [\"a long.\", \"Of time\"]},

\"You just want to feel something different.\", \"So you might so now I've introduced you to two types of relaxation exercises the last time we did a little bit of deep breathing and then a very muscle focused one and they just show something different because I want to give you options and you know, try it out.\", \"You can try it when you're not panicking, but when you are panicking and know that you're safe.\", \"You know if you're sitting in a chair.\", \"Answer to be a little bit busy.\", \"It's a different feeling but that's not a dangerous feeling to you.\", \"And it sometimes people feel dizzy because they're paying so much attention to their breath in a way that they're not used to paying attention to it.\", \"And that's why I only had you do it for a few minutes.\",

enough to move you out of where you are two different place.\", \"Okay.\", \"I will see you on Monday.\", \"Yeah regular time.\"]}]"
